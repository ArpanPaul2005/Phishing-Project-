# Phishing-Project-

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how phishing attacks work at a conceptual and technical level using the open-source tool Zphisher.
The primary goal of this project is to understand phishing techniques, analyze how attackers deceive users, and learn how such attacks can be detected, prevented, and mitigated in real-world systems.

⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project is strictly for educational purposes, cybersecurity awareness, and authorized testing only.
Unauthorized use of phishing tools to collect credentials or impersonate services is illegal and unethical.

🧠 What is Phishing?

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker attempts to:

Imitate a trusted website or service

Trick users into entering sensitive information

Capture credentials such as usernames and passwords

This project focuses on how phishing pages are structured, not on committing real attacks.

🛠️ About Zphisher

Zphisher is an open-source phishing simulation framework written primarily in Bash and PHP.
It provides:

Pre-built website templates for learning purposes

Local hosting of simulated login pages

Logging mechanisms to demonstrate how data capture occurs

Zphisher is commonly used in:

Cybersecurity labs

Ethical hacking courses

Awareness demonstrations

📥 High-Level Setup & Deployment (Conceptual)

⚠️ No real-world deployment or public exposure is performed in this project.

At a conceptual level, the workflow is as follows:

Obtain the Source Code

The project uses the official Zphisher open-source repository from GitHub.

The repository contains scripts and template files for phishing simulation.

Local Environment Setup

The tool runs in a Linux-based environment (native Linux, virtual machine, or WSL).

Required components include:

A shell environment

A local web server (PHP-based)

Networking utilities for local testing

Local Deployment

Phishing pages are hosted only on localhost or a closed lab network.

No public links are generated or shared.

Simulation Execution

A test phishing page is loaded locally.

Sample credentials are entered to observe how data capture works.

Logged data is analyzed to understand attacker techniques.

🔍 How This Project Uses Zphisher

This project uses Zphisher to:

Study phishing page structure

Understand how login forms are replicated

Observe credential logging mechanisms

Demonstrate why users fall for phishing attacks

Analyze weaknesses in human behavior, not systems

No real user data is collected.

🛡️ Defensive & Educational Applications

This project helps in learning:

How phishing attacks are created

How browser warnings and HTTPS protect users

How organizations train employees against phishing

How security teams detect fake login pages

Why multi-factor authentication (MFA) is important

⚖️ Legal & Ethical Considerations

This project complies with ethical hacking principles

All testing is done in a controlled environment

No third-party systems, accounts, or users are targeted

All credentials used are dummy/test data

Any misuse of phishing tools outside authorized environments is punishable under cyber laws.

🎓 Academic Relevance
